Nam Lhai is a traditional Thai weaving technique that creates flowing patterns reminiscent of water streams, inspired by the Nan rivers of the Chao Phraya River. This laborious woven pattern is used across various parts of Thai culture from clothing, decorations, and others. 

To translate this into a more accessible digital experience, a custom color typeface was created from scratch, where glyphs recreate Nam Lhai patterns. I re-imagined the keyboard as a loom – akin to the way we combine letters and words to form a language, the website allows people to ‘weave’ patterns through their keyboard by laying down the colored fabric and adding patterns on top through specific keys. 

People are invited to engage in an act of ‘weaving’, learn more about the historical context through the website,  and gain a greater appreciation of pattern combinations of Nam Lhai – a craft almost forgotten.
